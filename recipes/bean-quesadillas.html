<br>
<h2>How do I make it?</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6</li>
    <li>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your <strong>garlic</strong></li>
    <li>Drain and rinse your <strong>kidney beans</strong></li>
    <li> Heat a pot with a drizzle of <strong>olive oil</strong> over a medium heat</li>
    <li>Once hot, add the <strong>chopped garlic</strong> and cook for 1 min</li>
    <li>Add your <strong>ground smoked paprika</strong> and ground cumin and cook for 30 secs further</li>
    <li>Add the <strong>drained kidney beans</strong> with 100ml cold water and bring to the boil</li>
    <li>Cook for 4-5 min or until the beans are beginning to soften</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, trim and finely slice your <strong>spring onion</strong> and add to a large mixing bowl</li>
    <li>Drain your <strong>sweetcorn</strong> and add it to the bowl</li>
    <li>Grate your <strong>cheddar cheese</strong> into the bowl, season with a generous pinch of <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>pepper</strong> and mix thoroughly – this is your <strong>cheesy sweetcorn mixture</strong></li>
    <li>Once the <strong>kidney beans</strong> are beginning to break down, season with a generous pinch of <strong>salt</strong> and squeeze in the juice of <strong>half your lime</strong></li>
    <li>Remove the beans from the heat and mash into a semi-smooth paste – these are your <strong>refried beans</strong></li>
    <li>Divide the <strong>refried beans</strong> and <strong>cheesy sweetcorn mixture</strong> between your <strong>tortillas</strong>, covering only half</li>
    <li>Fold each tortilla over and press down firmly so you're left with 3 half moon-shaped sandwiches per person – these are your <strong>quesadillas</strong></li>
    <li>Add the <strong>quesadillas</strong> to a baking tray (or two!)</li>
    <li>Place a second baking tray[s] on top to weigh them down slightly</li>
    <li>Put the stacked trays in the oven for 10 min or until the quesadillas are slightly browned and the cheese has melted – these are your <strong>refried bean & corn quesadillas</strong></li>
    <li>Meanwhile, combine the juice of the <strong>remaining lime</strong> with 2 tbsp <strong>olive oil</strong> and a pinch of <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>pepper</strong> – this is your <strong>salad dressing</strong></li>
    <li>Combine your <strong>chipotle paste</strong> (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and <strong>mayo</strong> with a drizzle of <strong>olive oil</strong> – this is your <strong>chipotle mayo</strong></li>
    <li>Slice the <strong>refried bean & corn quesadillas</strong> in half</li>
    <li>Wash your <strong>salad</strong>, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and toss it in the <strong>salad dressing</strong></li>
    <li>Serve the <strong>halved refried bean & corn quesadillas</strong> alongside the <strong>dressed salad</strong> and the <strong>chipotle mayo for dipping</strong></li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
