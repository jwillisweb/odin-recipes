        <li>Flat white mushrooms (150g)</li>
        <li>Arborio rice (160g)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>You'll also need</h4>
    <p>butter, olive oil, pepper, salt, water <strong>(or dietary alternatives)</strong></p>
<br>
<h2>How do I make it?</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle</li>
    <li>Chop your <strong>chestnut mushrooms</strong> finely</li>
    <li>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your <strong>garlic</strong></li>
    <li>Chop your <strong>leek</strong> in half lengthways, wash thoroughly to remove any grit then top, tail and slice finely</li>
    <li>Crush your <strong>hazelnuts</strong> roughly in the bag with a rolling pin</li>
    <li>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat, then once hot, add the <strong>crushed hazelnuts</strong> and cook for 1-2 min or until lightly coloured, then transfer to a plate and set aside, reserve the pan</li>
    <li><strong>Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!</strong></li>
    <li>Dissolve your <strong>vegetable stock mix</strong> in 750ml boiled water</li>
    <li>Grate your <strong>Italian hard cheese</strong></li>
    <li>Return the pan to a medium heat with a generous drizzle of <strong>olive oil</strong>, add the <strong>sliced leek</strong> with a generous pinch of <strong>salt</strong> and cook for 8-10 min or until softened, then add the <strong>chopped garlic</strong> and cook for 2-3 min further</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, strip your <strong>thyme leaves</strong> from their stems, discard the stems</li>
    <li>Add your Chinese rice wine with <strong>half the thyme leaves</strong> (save the rest for later!) and the <strong>chopped mushrooms</strong> and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften</li>
    <li>Once the mushrooms have started to soften, add your <strong>arborio rice</strong> and cook for 1 min or until the grains are fully coated in the oil</li>
    <li>Add the <strong>vegetable stock</strong> a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked</li>
    <li>Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper, then slice your <strong>flat white mushroom[s]</strong> into wedges and add to the tray</li>
    <li>Sprinkle over the remaining <strong>thyme leaves</strong>, drizzle with <strong>olive oil</strong> and season generously with <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>black pepper</strong></li>
    <li>Put the tray in the oven and cook for 5-6 min or until the flat white mushroom wedges are cooked through – these are your <strong>thyme-roasted flat white mushrooms</strong></li>
    <li>Line a separate baking tray with non-stick baking paper, add 1/4 of the <strong>grated Italian hard cheese</strong> (you'll use the rest later!) to the tray, and form into a long rectangular shape</li>
    <li>Put the tray in the oven for 7-8 min or until the cheese has completely melted and is starting to brown</li>
    <li>Once melted, remove the tray from the oven and set aside to cool</li>
    <li>Once cooled, snap into 1 equal sized piece per person – these are your <strong>cheese tuiles</strong></li>
    <li>Once the rice is cooked, remove the pan from the heat</li>
    <li>Stir in half your <strong>truffle oil</strong> (save the rest for later!), the remaining <strong>grated Italian hard cheese</strong> and a large knob of <strong>butter</strong> – this is your <strong>truffled mushroom risotto</strong></li>
    <li>Serve the <strong>truffled mushroom risotto</strong> topped with the <strong>thyme-roasted flat white mushrooms</strong> and <strong>crushed hazelnuts</strong></li>
    <li>Drizzle with the <strong>remaining truffle oil</strong> and top with a <strong>cheese tuile</strong></li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
